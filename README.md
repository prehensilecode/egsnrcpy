egsnrcpy
========

Classes to manipulate phantoms and dose distributions used by EGSnrc.

This is very pre-alpha. See INSTALL for installation instructions.

Requires numpy. Also requires a scanf module, e.g. https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/scanf/ 
This is another scanf module, but untested in this code: https://pypi.org/project/scanf/

See dentalwork_slides.pdf for some of the visualizations produce by this package.
